## Pre-requisistes
* This plugin relies on Fiati font being installed, which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/eduardomourar/fiati/releases For windows 10 users: Make sure to install the font for "All Users" or MuseScore (and thus this plugin) won't have access to it.

## Support of MS4.0
**NOT SUPPORTED**

MuseScore 4.0 support for plugin is minimal. Many functions are not supported for the time being or have changed.
